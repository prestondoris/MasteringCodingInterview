Algorithms: Sorting

Sorting Algorithms
  -Radix Sort
  -Quick Sort
  -Bubble Sort
  -Selection Sort
  -Heap Sort
  -Insertion Sort
  -Merge Sort
  -Counting Sort

Bubble Sort
  -Usually the first thing that comes to mind when trying to Sort
  -You bubble up the largest values at each iteration

Selection Sort 
  -The algorithms works by looking for the smallest item then\
  swaps it with element in the first position 

Insertion Sort
  -

O(n log(n)) is the runtime that good sorting algorithms achieve in average and worst case

Merge Sort and Quick Sort are algorithms that use the concept of divide and conquer.
  -Divide and Conquer usually gives a log(n) advantage
