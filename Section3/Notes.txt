BigO Asymtotic Analysis
1. This tells us how well a problem is solved.
  -This is a metric to compare it other algorithms
  -It is simply a performance metric

What is good code?
-Readable
-Scalable
  -BigO gives us a metric to tell us if our code can scale

-A Coder is someone who gives the computer the instructions needed to 
achieve a desired result. There are ways that the instructions can be good or bad

-The Runtime: how long does it take to run a certain problem through a function or task.

-Algorithmic Efficiency: as the number of items increases how many more operations do 
we have to do. BigO allows us to explain this concept.

-When we talk about BigO and scallability we are talking about when we grow bigger and 
bigger with our input how much does it slow down.

-BigO allows us and concerns us with how many steps it takes in a function.
-Linear Time: O(n), as the input grows so does the runtime linearly.
  -The findNemo function is a Linear Time function.
