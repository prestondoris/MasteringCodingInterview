-The coder that answers the question, "Will you solve the companies problem?" is the person that will get hired.
-First we have to understand BigO
-Then we have to learn how to solve the problems in a way that companies like.
  -Once we have this down all we have to do is use the data stuctures and algorimths to solve these problems.

What are companies looking for?
-Analytic Skills
  -They want to know how you analyze a problem. They want to know your thought process
-Coding Skills
  -Do you code well, is it clean, well organized, readable
-Technical Skills
  -Do you know the fundamentals
  -Do you understand the pros and cons of different solutions
-Communication Skills 
  -Can you work well and communicate well with others
