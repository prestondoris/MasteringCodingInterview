Data Structures: Arrays

Arrays (lists)
  -organize items sequentially and are called contiguous because they stored in 
  in memory in order
  -RunTimes
    -lookup: O(1)
    -push: O(1)
    -insert: O(n)
    -delete: O(n)

There are two types of arrays: static and dynamic
  -One limitation of static arrays is that they are fixed in size
    -you must specify how big the array is when it is initialized
    -this allows the computer to know how many shelfs it needs to allocate
  -A dynamic array will copy the data to a new location in memory that has more
  room in memory to add more items to that array 
    -appends for dynamics arrays are normally O(1), but can be O(n) because when 
    the array has to dynamically increase it will have to loop over all items to copy
    them to a new space in memory
